Source,,,Description,,,,,
,,,"In the third quarter of 2021, The Walt Disney Company reported that Hulu had 42.8 million paid subscribers, up from 35.5 million in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year. Hulu has several different pricing plans to cater to varying consumer preferences, with the most basic option costing 5.99 dollars per month and the priciest monthly subscription package fixed at 70.99 dollars as of January 2021. The latter includes premium membership (which offers customers ad-free viewing), as well as live TV access, giving subscribers the opportunity to watch content from over 65 channels including CBS, NBC, and Food Network among many others. 



 What is Hulu best known for? 

Hulu is often best known for dystopian TV show ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ based on Margaret Atwood’s novel of the same name. The show has received a significant amount of media attention since its release, largely owing to its gripping plot and well-known cast members, as well as its intense and dark subject matter. Publications ranging from Forbes to The Guardian have written academic-style reviews, opinion-based commentaries, and analytical critiques about the show’s political and cultural relevance and aesthetic, launching Hulu into the spotlight again and again. The show was also highly regarded by critics on American review-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, and was among the TV shows with the highest amount of Primetime Emmy Awards nominations in 2021.


 Hulu's history 
Content aside, Hulu’s current and past dealings with other media companies have also been a frequent point of discussion. The company was founded in 2007 and its board has included American investment firms as well as representatives from stakeholders Disney, Fox, and Comcast. A lot changed in early 2019 when The Walt Disney Company acquired 21st Century Fox, a deal which generated enormous online buzz and which gave Disney a 60 percent majority stake in Hulu. Shortly afterwards, multinational conglomerate AT&T sold back its own ten percent stake to Disney. Finally, Comcast announced that it had agreed to hand over its 33 percent stake in Hulu in the coming years. Disney’s new streaming service, Disney+ , is available as part of a bundle including ESPN (for sports fans) and of course, Hulu, which will cater to more mature audiences whilst Disney+ takes care of the family-friendly content.
