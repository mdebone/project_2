Background
Scrap Hulu, Netflix, HBO, and Disney to find the most streamed during the pandemic, see if A) there is an increase in subscriptions, B) how much new content these services provided during the time frame under consideration. Both are obvious drivers of increased subscription rates

Motivation 
Khaled likes movies! :-) 

Questions to answer
Does our data reflect the “Top 10 Trending Shows” on Netflix’s website?
Are the popular shows produced by the companies or bought?
What's the best value for money of the four, if you can only get one streaming service, what provides the most content?  ↪ see this

Stretch Goals:
Drop in movie theater attendance, driving up home viewership?
Incorporate  Amazon Prime, Apple TV

PROJECT PRESENTATION



Technical Requirements
Once you have identified your datasets, perform extract, transform, and load on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:
● The sources of data that you will extract from.
● The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
● The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
● The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
** You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your  extract, transform, and load process.**
At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:
● Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4,etc).
● Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
● Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
** Please upload the report to Github and submit a link to Bootcampspot.**
