# project_2

added a Resources folder for the hbo and disney+ csv's I found. Created 3 subfolders to keep everything organized, Disney+, HBO and 'Multi' for any data we find that has info from more than one streaming service. Feel free to make a Hulu and Netflix folders in the resources.

Added to Resources folder and created sub folders 'Hulu and Netflix.' Added csv files we retrieved from Kaggle.
